# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction
Hello Guys here I make a loan eligibility Prediction project by using Python. 

# Introduction
Welcome to our Loan Eligibility Prediction project! In this project, we're going to understand the process of getting loans and who can get them. No complicated words – just little use of machine learning algorithms.

We're looking at different things, like how much money someone makes, the amount they want to borrow, and their credit history. Imagine these factors as building blocks that fit together to decide if someone can get a loan. We're figuring out the right mix of ingredients that makes someone eligible for a loan.

By the end of this project, we will know exactly what goes into the decision-making process for loan eligibility.

Let's get started.

# Dataset
We will use two dataset:

**Train:**

Train is used to train the model it will have all the label(answers|yes/no) assign to it. Train is going to used to develop the model and test it's accuracy.

**Test:**

The test dataset won't have any predifined label, using the model we have built we will finding the assing class and label for the text dataset.

# Data Understanding
Attribute information:

Loan_ID: A unique identification number assigned to each loan application.

Gender: The gender of the applicant (e.g., Male).

Married: Indicates whether the applicant is married (e.g., Yes or No).

Dependents: The number of dependents the applicant has (e.g., 0, 1).

Education: The educational qualification of the applicant (e.g., Graduate or Not Graduate).

Self_Employed: Indicates whether the applicant is self-employed (e.g., Yes or No).

ApplicantIncome: The income of the applicant.

CoapplicantIncome: The income of the co-applicant, if any.

LoanAmount: The amount of the loan applied for.

Loan_Amount_Term: The term or duration of the loan in months.

Credit_History: A binary variable indicating whether the applicant has a credit history (e.g., 1 for Yes, 0 for No).

Property_Area: The area where the property associated with the loan is located (e.g., Urban, Rural).

Loan_Status: The final status of the loan application (e.g., Y for Yes, N for No).
